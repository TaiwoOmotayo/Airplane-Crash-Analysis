# Airplane Crashes Analysis Project

## Overview
Welcome to my Airplane Crashes Analysis project repository! In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of historical airplane crash data using Power BI for visualization and insights. This analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and contributing factors to airplane crashes, with a focus on improving safety measures and aviation practices.

## Project Files
- **Problem statement - Airplane crashes.pdf**: Document outlining my project's objectives, methodologies, and findings related to airplane crashes analysis.
- **Airplane Crashes Analysis.csv**: CSV file containing the dataset of historical airplane crashes used in my analysis.
- **Airplane Crashes Analysis- Mentorness.pbix**: Power BI file containing dashboards and visualizations of airplane crashes data.
- **README.md**: Detailed documentation providing project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Directory for storing additional datasets or backups used in my analysis.
- **reports/**: Contains exported reports or additional documents generated from Power BI for sharing insights externally.
- **README.md**: Comprehensive guide providing an overview of my project, setup instructions, and guidance on utilizing Power BI and data files.

## Setup Instructions
To replicate and extend my Airplane Crashes Analysis project locally:
1. Import `Airplane Crashes Analysis.csv` into Power BI Desktop to explore and visualize the airplane crash dataset.
2. Load `Airplane Crashes Analysis- Mentorness.pbix` to interact with pre-built dashboards and visualizations.
3. Review the `Problem statement - Airplane crashes.pdf` for detailed project objectives and methodologies.
4. Refer to my `README.md` file and project documentation for setup instructions, Power BI usage, and data file integration.

## Usage
- Utilize Power BI to explore patterns, trends, and contributing factors to airplane crashes.
- Use insights derived from my analysis to propose safety enhancements and inform aviation practices.
- Export reports or visualizations for sharing insights with stakeholders or incorporating into presentations and reports.
